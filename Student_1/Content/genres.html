                <p class="content">Electronic music, Any music involving electronic processing (e.g., recording and editing on tape) and whose reproduction involves the use of 
                    loudspeakers. In the late 1940s, magnetic tape began to be used, especially in France, to modify natural sounds (playing them backward, at 
                    different speeds, etc.), creating the genre known as musique concrète. By the early 1950s, composers in Germany and the U.S. were employing 
                    assembled conglomerations of oscillators, filters, and other equipment to produce entirely new sounds. The development of voltage-controlled 
                    oscillators and filters led, in the 1950s, to the first synthesizers, which effectively standardized the assemblages and made them more flexible. 
                    No longer relying on tape editing, electronic music could now be created in real time. Since their advent in the late 1970s, personal computers 
                    have been used to control the synthesizers. Digital sampling composing with music and sounds electronically extracted from other recordings has 
                    largely replaced the use of oscillators as a sound source.</p>

                <h2 id ="row2-title">Rock</h2>
                <p class = "content">Rock music is a broad genre of popular music that originated as "rock and roll" in the United States in the late 1940s and early 1950s, developing 
                    into a range of different styles in the mid-1960s and later, particularly in the United States and United Kingdom.[3] It has its roots in 1940s 
                    and 1950s rock and roll, a style that drew directly from the blues and rhythm and blues genres of African-American music and from country music. 
                    Rock also drew strongly from a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, classical, and other 
                    musical styles. For instrumentation, rock has centered on the electric guitar, usually as part of a rock group with electric bass guitar, drums, 
                    and one or more singers. Usually, rock is song-based music with a 4 time signature using a verse–chorus form, but the genre has become extremely 
                    diverse. Like pop music, lyrics often stress romantic love but also address a wide variety of other themes that are frequently social or political.</p>

                <h2 id ="row3-title">Country</h2>
                <p class = "content">Country (also called country and western) is a music genre originating in the Southern and Southwestern United States. First produced in the 1920s, 
                    country primarily focuses on working class Americans and blue-collar American life. Country music is known for its ballads and dance tunes (also 
                    known as "honky-tonk music") with simple form, folk lyrics, and harmonies accompanied by instruments such as banjos, fiddles, harmonicas, and many 
                    types of guitar (including acoustic, electric, steel, and resonator guitars). Though it is primarily rooted in various forms of American 
                    folk music, such as old-time music and Appalachian music, many other traditions, including African-American, Mexican, Irish, and Hawaiian 
                    music, have also had a formative influence on the genre. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. The term 
                    country music gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to hillbilly music; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to 
                    hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century.</p>

                <h2 id = "row4-title">Pop</h2>
                <p class = "content">Pop music is a genre of popular music that originated in its modern form during the mid-1950s in the United States and the United Kingdom. The 
                    terms popular music and pop music are often used interchangeably, although the former describes all music that is popular and includes many 
                    disparate styles. During the 1950s and 1960s, pop music encompassed rock and roll and the youth-oriented styles it influenced. Rock and pop 
                    music remained roughly synonymous until the late 1960s, after which pop became associated with music that was more commercial, ephemeral, and 
                    accessible. Although much of the music that appears on record charts is considered to be pop music, the genre is distinguished from chart music. 
                    Identifying factors usually include repeated choruses and hooks, short to medium-length songs written in a basic format (often the verse–chorus 
                    structure), and rhythms or tempos that can be easily danced to. Much pop music also borrows elements from other styles such as rock, urban, dance, 
                    Latin, and country.</p>
