        <p>We'll describe how music has developed significantly over the past thousand years. Gregorian Chants and 
            Mozart's sonatas are just a few examples of how the 6 Musical Periods have impacted music today. The six 
            musical eras are classified as Medieval, Renaissance, Baroque, Classical, Romantic, and 20th/21st Century, 
            with each generally corresponding to a distinct time period.</p>

                    <h1>Medieval (1150 – 1400)</h1>
                    <p> 
                        The Medieval era is the first in which we can be certain of how music sounded at this time, even though we can 
                        assume that music started much earlier than 1150. Since the church or locations associated with the church 
                        produced the majority of the notated manuscripts from the Middle Ages, most of the works have a sacred theme.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Gregorian Chant is arguably the most well-known genre of music to have emerged during the Middle Ages. Monks sang 
                        Gregorian Chants, which were monophonic (consisting of a single, solo melodic line). Listen to the Gregorian Chant in 
                        the video below for a minute. Also take note of the backdrop notation, which has evolved significantly over time.

                    <h1>Renaissance (1400 – 1600)</h1>
                    <p>Due to the majority of composers' attention being directed toward choral music, the Renaissance saw a substantial 
                        increase in harmony and polyphony in music.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Throughout the entirety of the Renaissance, religious music flourished, and new genres like masses, hymns, psalms,
                         and motets were developed. Toward the conclusion of the era, some sacred music composers started utilizing 
                         secular forms (like the madrigal). Listen for a minute to Orlando Gibbons' well-known choral composition 
                         "The Silver Swan," which is still performed today.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The second part of the Renaissance had a significant impact on composers as they began to organize their works
                        using major and minor scales rather than the modal harmony system.

                    <p>
                        The creation of writing music in a specific key dates back to the Baroque era, which built on the end of the 
                        Renaissance. However, the Baroque era is well known for its intricate rhythms and challenging compositions. 
                        However, this time set the stage for the following 300 years of music.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Along with opera, the concerto, sonata, and cantata, the concept of the contemporary orchestra was created. 
                        With the rise of instrumental works for different groups, instrumental music no longer reigned supreme over 
                        choral music. "Classical" music started to slowly permeate society, either as a spectacle in the shape of opera 
                        or outside at dinner parties and other special occasions.
                    </p>

                <div class="paragraph">
                    <h1>Classical (1750 – 1820)</h1>
                    <p>"Classical music" has two distinct definitions. The term's wider definition embraces all Western art music from 
                        the Middle Ages to the present. The particular reference is to music that was popular from the 1750s to the early 
                        1820s. In this part, we'll go over the precise meaning. The Baroque era was enhanced by the Classical period, 
                        which also introduced the sonata, a highly influential new song form. The concerto, symphony, sonata, trio, and 
                        quintet were also developed during this time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The requirement for structural precision in music is what sets the Classical era apart.Joseph Haydn, 
                        Ludwig van Beethoven, Franz Schubert, and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart are just a few of the notable classical musicians.

                <div class="paragraph">
                    <h1>Romantic (1820 – 1900)</h1>
                    <p>The transition between the Classical and Romantic eras of music was made by Beethoven and Schubert. As implied by the term "romantic,"
                         this time period added obscene amounts of intensity and expression to classical music. As the era progressed, composers progressively
                          shifted away from highly structured works and toward drama and emotion.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With orchestras becoming more numerous than ever, instrumentation became even more important. Composers explored new avenues of 
                        experimentation, utilizing unusual instrumentation combos and expanding the boundaries of harmony. The urban middle class society 
                        began to host public concerts and operas, bringing them out of the exclusive realm of monarchy and wealth.

                    <p> Even more discrete time eras can be created from the 20th and 21st centuries. Up until the 20th and 21st centuries, every age had a common set 
                        of rules and traits that the majority of composers adhered to. Composers have been moving away from guidelines and limitations over 
                        time, eventually arriving at a location where they are completely free to create. Even though it may not be as well-known today as it 
                        was in 1800, classical music is still a venue for the highest level of innovation.
